# CoreXNU
An extremely minimal XNU install comprising the kernel, supporting dynamic libraries (identified with otool) and a bash shell. Uses a bash script in place of launchd. Inspired by PureDarwin nano (https://sites.google.com/a/puredarwin.org/puredarwin/downloads/puredarwin-nano). Built based on El Capitan OS X 10.11.6 (15G22010).
